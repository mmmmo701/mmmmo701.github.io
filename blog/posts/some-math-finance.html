            <article class="content">
                <p>
                    Today, I started to read the first section of <em>Mathematics of Finance</em> by Donald G. Saari. I downloaded this book a while ago, and since today is Thanksgiving break. I finally have time for it. Here are some notes I took while reading.
                </p>
                <h3>The Story</h3>
                <p>
                    The book begins with a story of gambling on football. Vikings and Packers are two football team, and Bob is a Vikings fan, so he offers a 25 to 1 odds on Vikings. This means that for every dollar bet against him, he will have to pay $25 if Vikings lose. Therefore, assume you bet \(x\) dollars against Bob (on Packers), then you will win \(25x\) dollars if Packers win, and you will lose your \(x\) dollars if Packers lose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sue, on the other hand, like Packers, so Sue offers a 6 to 5 odds on Packers. This means that if you bet \(y\) dollars against Sue (on Vikings), then you will win \(\frac{6}{5}y\) dollars if Vikings win, and you will lose your \(y\) dollars if Vikings lose.
                </p>
                <h3>The Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    If we only bet on one side, we will lose money if the side lose, so we can bet on both side to alleviate the loss. Surprisingly, there are sometimes ways that we can never lose money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Assume I have $100, and I bet \(x\) dollars against Bob, and \(100 - x\) dollars against Sue. In this way, let \(f(x)\) be my net balance if Vikings win, and \(g(x)\) be my net balance if Packers win, then
                    $$
                    f(x) = \frac{6}{5}(100 - x) - x = 120 - \frac{11}{5}x,
                    $$
                    and
                    $$
                    g(x) = 25x - (100 - x) = 26x - 100.
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's our central question framed in math: does there exist an \(x\) such that \(f(x) > 0\) and \(g(x) > 0\)? The answer, if you solve the system of inequalities, is yes. When I bet \(\frac{100}{26} < x < \frac{600}{11}\) dollars against Bob, I am guarenteed to win money regardless of which football team wins eventually.
                </p>
                <h3>Take it Further</h3>
                <p>
                    For example, if I bet $10 against Bob and $90 against Sue, then if Vikings win, my net balance is
                    $$
                    f(10) = \frac{6}{5} \cdot 90 - 10 = 108 - 10 = 98,
                    $$
                    and if Packers win, my net balance is
                    $$
                    g(10) = 25 \cdot 10 - 90 = 250 - 90 = 160.
                    $$
                    In both cases, I make money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, I don't llike when my net balance is not the same in both cases. Is there a way to make my net balance the same regardless of which team wins? Yes. We can set \(f(x) = g(x)\) and solve for \(x\):
                    $$
                    120 - \frac{11}{5}x = 26x - 100,
                    $$
                    which gives \(x = \frac{1100}{141} = 7.80\). Therefore, if I bet about $7.80 against Bob and the rest (about $92.20) against Sue, then my net balance will be the same regardless of which team wins.
                </p>
                <h3>It Doesn't Work All The Time</h3>
                <p>
                    Note that this strategy doesn't always work, because the system of ineqaualities doesn't always has a solution. Generally, some algebra can show that if the product of the two odds is less than 1, then there does not exist a way to bet on both side and never lose money. Otherwise, there exists such a way.
